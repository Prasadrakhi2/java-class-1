//DP => dynamic Programming (Optimized recursion)
//1. Based on devide and concure , use extra memory to store the previous result
//2. use "memoization" => i.e use extra memory to store the result for the further use and reduse the time complexity

// use where "branches" are form and it want the optimal
// 1. mamoization (top down) => (use recursion)          2.Tabulation (bottum up)=>(use iteration )
